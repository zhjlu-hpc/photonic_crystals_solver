# photonic_crystals_solver
This project is to compute the band gaps of photonic crystals. There are two main parts: three-dimensional discretizations of Maxwell equations for photonic crystals with edge elements and an eigensolver for large-scale systems. The code is written in Matlab 2019b and can be run on GPU with Matlab Parallel Computing Toolbox.    
The m-file “test_crystals_band_gaps.m” is the test case.

This project is supported by NSFC Grant No. 12101586.
